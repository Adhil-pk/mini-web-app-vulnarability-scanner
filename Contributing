# Architecture (mini)

- `app.py` uses `scanner.SimpleScanner` to run scans (spawned in a background thread in the example).
- `scanner.py` performs crawling, form extraction, and safe marker-based testing.
- Findings are logged to an SQLite DB by the `Logger` class.
- Additions: authentication handling, headless browser support (Selenium/Playwright), and extra heuristics can be added iteratively.
